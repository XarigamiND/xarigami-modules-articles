# XarigamiND Articles Module

Articles is a Xarigami Content Module responsible 
for the creation and handling of generic and complex content structures. 

The articles module can manage 'articles' of different types at the 
same time, for instance news articles, longer documents in different sections,
frequently asked questions, and so on.

These types are called 'publication types', and each type of article can
make use of a different set of data fields, with a different meaning 
for each data field. For example, the 'summary' field could be used for
an Introduction in news articles, for providing some details about a
question in FAQs, or not be used at all for section documents.

There is a specific menu where you can manage those publication types, 
change the description that will appear in navigation menus, enable and 
disable data fields or change their meaning for a particular type, or even 
create or delete publication types according to your needs.

Each publication type also has its own templates, so that you can customize 
the look & feel of how each article will appear to your visitors.
