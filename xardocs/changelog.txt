Version 1.5.7 : 2009-10-25 by 2skies.com
----------------------------------------
- Added new moderate articles mask
- Added ability to check out article in bulk - similar to 'lock' facility
- Updated relevant functions to now only show approve etc or checking if moderator level or above
- Allow users to more easily access submitted documents if they have edit/own access
- Updated the Status property so it only displays drop down when the user has access rights to it (moderate level)
- Users with Edit access can no longer approve articles - they must have Moderate access level
- Template changes:
    : admin-view.xd - added new $canmod variable to replace check for editing access. This prevents users from accessing the
                        dropdown options to approve to frontpage, approved, etc and also removes the checkbox for these bulk actions.
                        Check for this $canmod variable in a number of places in the template
                    - Remove new article link - just use the Add article tab
                    - added new drop down selector for pubtypes
                    - added new bulk checkout facility - this needs to be added
    : admin-modifyconfig.xd - added new dropdown options for pubtypes
    : admin-new.xd - added new dropdown options for pubtypes

- UPGRADE NOTE:
  -For sites that allow users to edit and approve documents, please change your privilege level for these users to ModerateAccess instead of Edit Access.

Version 1.5.5 : 2007-07-19 by 2skies.com
----------------------------------------

- Get rid of the create hook. Incorrectly added from another articles scenario.
- Database upgrade for hook removal

Other changes in this version:
- fixes for pubtype dropdown selection validations
- other minor bug fixes in articles
- various small features

- Added simple 'group by category' as an option for display of article summaries
  This displays summaries in one page, grouped by categories.
  The categories used for grouping are subcategories of one category nominated in the
  article pubtype configuration.
- No db changes for group by category
- Templates must be updated specifically:

  :user-view.xd  - and overrides.  Please see user-view.xd for changes.


Version 1.5.4 : 2007-07-17 by 2skies.com
----------------------------------------
- Finalized basic article checkin- checkout capability. Currently implemented
  as changes in the articles tables as we want to integrate this with changelog
  and currently having 2 hooks without control of order of action complicates
  implmentation. For now, there is simple checkin-checkout capability,
  article versioning coming soon.

- There are database upgrades - should upgrade smoothly in usual xaraya upgrade process
  from modules admin. Activate the module afterwards.

- There are key template changes in system templates. These must be updated in your own
  theme overrides. Templates and reasoning as follows:
  : admin-view.xd - critical changes here in a few places (noted) to display
                    whether an article is checked in or out.
                  - You must updated your overrides for admin-view.xd with the
                    changes including admin-view-*.xt.
                    Edit and delete links are inactive when an article
                    is checked out, except for the author currently editing.
                    Checkout time and editor is noted.
                  - bulk checking also implemented via the select all/deselect all
                     checkboxes.
 : admin-modify.xd - critical change here to display a checkbox that is used
                     to choose whether a an article is checked back in or not
                     on saving and exit from editing of the document.
                     This change must be added to all your overrides for
                     admin-modify.xd including admin-modify-*.xt files
                     Change is noted in admin-modify.xd
 : user-display.xd - this is an optional change that must be implemented in
                     all your user-display-*.xt overrides.
                     Has two purposes:
                     - to display the last edit time (and editor if so desired)
                       from the last checkin time
                     - integrates changelog hook display with the checkin-checkout
                       if changelog module is hooked so the last edit time
                       is taken over by changelog.

Note that checkin-checkout functionality is a different process to
changelog history although shares similar functionality. The integration between
both checkin-checkout functionality and changelog will be integrated in future versions
and the checkin-checkout functionality extended to other modules.

Version 1.5.3 : 2007-07-17 by 2skies.com
-------------------------------------
Interim version - commencement of checkin-checkout functionality for urgent requirement.
Unstable version.
